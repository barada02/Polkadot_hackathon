Bring Web2 Applications to Web3
One of Web3's key promises is to deliver a decentralized and fair internet where users control their own data, identity, and destiny. So far, the smart contracts-driven Web3 applications centered around cryptocurrency, payments, decentralized finance, and memes have dominated the Web3 and Blockchain technology narrative. Polkadot is set out to expand Web3's horizons through its Rust-powered SDK and Web3 Cloud architecture.

In this 6-week hackathon, use any of the Polkadot ecosystem's SDKs, APIs, Tools, and Infrastructure to build apps or proofs of concept to compete for a $40K prize pool. Our motto: radically open, radically useful.

We recommend that you submit your projects under one of three themes:

User-centric Apps: Staying true to the principles of Web3, build apps that prioritize the user's interests and have real-world impact using the decentralized Polkadot Technology Stack and its ecosystem projects, Polkadot and/or Parachain APIs, tools, and infrastructure. 

Build a Blockchain - The Polkadot SDK enables you to seamlessly build and deploy custom blockchains to the Polkadot Cloud for use cases that cannot be realized through smart contracts. With Polkadot SDK's ready-to-use blockchain templates, you can explore novel Web3 use cases.
Polkadot Tinkerers - we leave this one open to your imagination. Tinker with Polkadot's libraries, apps, privacy tech, on-chain compute, and cross-chain magic, do data crunching/visualizations, improve UX of existing apps and also vibe code! Also, create proof of concepts with the Polkadot technology stack and bring your ideas to life.

Judging Criteria
Technological Implementation
Does the project demonstrate quality software development and usage of Polkadot technology? Does the project thoroughly leverage Polkadot tools? How is the quality of the code?
Design
Is the user experience and design of the project well thought out?
Potential Impact
How big of an impact could the project have on the Polkadot community? How big of an impact could it have beyond Polkadot?
Creativity
How creative and unique is the project? Does the concept exist already? If so, how much does the project improve on it?
